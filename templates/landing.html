    <h1 class="h1"> The School Bus Problem</h1>
    <h3 class="h3"> On September 13 in 2021, a man driving a truck ran through a stop sign and hit the side
        of a school bus carrying children to school. Luckily, none of the children were seriously injured but it
        showed a large flaw in our current system. 
    </h3>
    <h3 class="h3">The bus administrators had no idea which kids were on the bus.</h3>
    <h3 class="h3">
        They had a list of children who were supposed to be on the bus, but this didn't account for any inconsistencies.
        Did your child stay home from school that day? Did your child stay after school for an extracurricular activity?
        Did your child accidentally get on the wrong bus? Or did they get on a different bus to go to their friends house?
    </h3>
    <h3 class="h3">These questions bring to light the failures of our current system. </h3>
    <h3 class="h3">
        The point of this program is to remove the potential "what if's" in the event that a horrible situation like this occures. It allows the bus driver (User view) to know the names of the students on their bus route and 
        log them into and off the bus.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="h3">
        It allows the Administrators (Admin view) to see the critical information of the students and by looking at a 
        bus route, quickly determine who is and isn't on the bus allowing them to contact the parents of the kids affected.
    </h3>    
    <h3 class="h3"> Implementing a program like this will reduce response time in the event of an emergency and give
        parents the peace of mind knowing they will quickly be notified if a tragedy happens.
